# Extract WebChannel message processing and storage adapters

## Summary

Carve the remaining message-processing and storage adapter logic out of
`runtime/src/channels/web.ts` into a focused service/module without changing
`processChat()` behavior, `storeMessage()` persistence semantics, default-agent
identity shaping, thread/media/content-block handling, or the public
`WebChannel` methods used by the handler/runtime surfaces.

This is the next bounded execution slice under:
- `kanban/20-doing/split-webchannel-god-class.md`

after the queued follow-up, server lifecycle/websocket gateway,
SSE/session-broadcast, recovery/runtime-state, message-write, endpoint facade,
agent control-plane, terminal/VNC HTTP, adaptive-card/side-prompt,
peer-message relay, and agent-message entry seams landed.

The goal is to keep `WebChannel` as a thin coordinator while moving:
- `processChat()`
- `storeMessage()`
- any adjacent default-agent identity / persistence adapter glue

behind a narrower, testable seam.

## Scope

Target only the message-processing/storage adapter responsibilities currently
owned by `WebChannel`, including logic around:

- forwarding into `processAgentChat(...)`
- shaping the `storeWebMessage(...)` call context
- preserving default agent id/name identity behavior
- preserving thread/media/content-block and steering/terminal reply semantics

Expected source surfaces:
- `runtime/src/channels/web.ts`
- any new focused service/helper file(s) created for this slice
- `runtime/test/channels/web/`

## Non-goals

- No deeper `web/handlers/agent.ts` decomposition in this slice
- No message-write service behavior changes
- No queue/control-plane changes
- No payload or public API changes
- No UI bundle work in this slice

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Message-processing/storage adapters move behind a focused service/module with a narrower interface than `WebChannel`.
- [ ] Existing behavior remains unchanged for:
  - [ ] `processChat()` delegation semantics
  - [ ] `storeMessage()` persistence and identity shaping
  - [ ] thread/media/content-block / steering / terminal-reply handling
  - [ ] public WebChannel method signatures and status behavior relied on by handlers/tests
- [ ] `runtime/src/channels/web.ts` loses another meaningful chunk of adapter glue.
- [ ] Focused tests exist or are strengthened for the extracted seam.
- [ ] Existing relevant `web-channel` integration tests still pass.
- [ ] No new `any` usage is introduced.

## Recommended Path

Extract a dedicated message-processing/storage adapter seam while keeping
`WebChannel.processChat()` and `WebChannel.storeMessage()` as thin delegates.

## Test Plan

- [ ] Add or strengthen focused tests for:
  - `processChat()` delegation
  - `storeMessage()` identity/persistence shaping
  - handler compatibility with the extracted seam
- [ ] Re-run affected integration coverage from:
  - `runtime/test/channels/web/web-channel.test.ts`
  - `runtime/test/channels/web/web-agent-streaming.test.ts`
  - `runtime/test/channels/web/message-write-service.test.ts`
- [ ] Run validation in repair-first order:
  1. focused processing/storage tests
  2. targeted `web-channel` tests
  3. `bun run lint`
  4. `bun run typecheck`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Extracted message-processing/storage seam is mergeable back to `main`.
- [ ] Focused and integration validation are green.
- [ ] Ticket `## Updates` records commands, evidence, and files touched.
- [ ] Parent WebChannel split ticket is updated to reflect the next chosen seam.

## Updates

### 2026-03-28
- Created as the next bounded execution slice under `split-webchannel-god-class` after the agent-message entry seam landed.
- Chosen because `processChat()` and `storeMessage()` remain the last substantive message-processing/storage adapters still living directly on `WebChannel`.
- Intended for the same repair-first loop: focused seam tests first, then extraction, then targeted `web-channel` validation, then lint/typecheck.
- Quality: ★★★★☆ 8/10 (problem: 2, scope: 2, test: 2, deps: 1, risk: 1)
