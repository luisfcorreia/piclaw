# Fix active/inactive streaming-state mismatch for queue submit

## Summary

There appears to be a distinct bug where the web UI behaves as though the
current turn is still active/queueable, but the backend no longer considers the
chat to be in a streaming state.

When that happens, a normal submit that the user expects to be queued is instead
persisted immediately as a new top-level user turn.

This looks separate from the queue-corruption / mid-queue-removal bug because
it can happen even when the queue itself is otherwise intact.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] If the user submits while the UI presents the turn as active/queueable, the request does not silently bypass queueing because of stale frontend/backend streaming-state disagreement.
- [ ] A message intended as a queued follow-up is never persisted immediately as a fresh turn solely because the backend's `isStreaming(chatJid)` flipped false before the UI caught up.
- [ ] The server/client contract for queue intent is explicit enough that active-turn queue submissions are handled deterministically.
- [ ] If queueing is no longer possible because the active run has actually ended, the UI state is corrected promptly so the user does not believe the message was queued.
- [ ] Fixture coverage reproduces the mismatch window and proves the chosen behavior.

## Implementation Paths

### Path A — Make queue intent server-authoritative

Treat queue intent as an explicit request mode with deterministic backend
handling, rather than implicitly depending on the instantaneous backend
`isStreaming(chatJid)` check.

Potential directions:

- accept explicit queue intent for a short grace window tied to active-turn state
- return an explicit response that the run is no longer queueable, so the UI can
  correct state immediately instead of silently persisting as a normal turn
- avoid a path where the message simply becomes a fresh turn without the user
  understanding why

Pros:
- clearer semantics
- less dependence on timing races
- easier to reason about from the user's perspective

Cons:
- requires contract decisions between UI and backend

### Path B — Tighten frontend/backend active-state synchronization

Reduce or eliminate the mismatch window by making the UI refresh authoritative
agent status/queueability more aggressively before submit.

Possible approaches:

- stronger use of `/agent/status`
- more precise terminal transition handling
- explicit queueability state rather than reusing generic "agent active" UI

Pros:
- smaller protocol change
- keeps current queue behavior model mostly intact

Cons:
- still timing-sensitive if the core contract remains ambiguous

## Test Plan

- [ ] Add/extend `piclaw/test/channels/web/web-channel.test.ts`
  - simulate UI-intended queue submit while backend `isStreaming()` is false
  - assert deterministic behavior (queued, or explicit non-queueable response)
- [ ] Add/extend relevant frontend tests if needed to cover queueability state transitions.
- [ ] Run `bun run quality`.
- [ ] Verify against DB rows that a queue-intended submit no longer silently becomes a fresh top-level turn during the mismatch window.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Root cause confirmed in code/tests
- [ ] Active/inactive mismatch regression test added
- [ ] Queue-intended submit path is deterministic under state transition races
- [ ] User-facing behavior is clear when queueing is no longer available
- [ ] `bun run quality` passes

## Updates

### 2026-03-14
- Lane: `next` → `doing` per explicit user instruction, even though this takes the doing lane above the preferred WIP limit.
- This remains scoped to active/inactive streaming-state mismatch rather than queue corruption after mid-queue removal, but the two tickets stay linked because the symptoms were observed in the same live sequence.
- Evidence: rows `7701` and `7705`, plus the queue-state/runtime observations captured below.
- Quality: ★★★★☆ 8/10 (problem: 2, scope: 2, test: 1, deps: 2, risk: 1)

### 2026-03-13
- Lane: `next` (split out from broader queue corruption follow-up).
- Live evidence suggests a distinct frontend/backend streaming-state mismatch:
  - `commit and reload` was expected to queue but was instead persisted immediately as row `7701`
  - `cleanup /workspace/tmp files older than 24h` was expected to queue but was instead persisted immediately as row `7705`
- At those moments, the UI still appeared to be in an active-turn / queueable state, but the backend did not take the deferred queue path.
- The current likely boundary is:
  - frontend defaults to queue based on UI-active state
  - backend only defers when `agentPool.isStreaming(chatJid)` is true
- These observations happened after the user deleted an item from the middle of the queue in the web UI; that action may be causal or may have widened a separate streaming-state mismatch window.
- This ticket is intentionally separate from `fix-queued-message-loss-after-mid-queue-removal.md` because the mismatch may exist even without queue corruption, but the mid-queue UI deletion remains important context for the observed sequence.
- Quality: ★★★★☆ 8/10 (problem: 2, scope: 2, test: 1, deps: 2, risk: 1)

## Notes

- The desired product behavior may be either:
  - preserve queue intent through a brief backend transition window, or
  - fail explicitly and update UI state immediately.
- What should not happen is silent conversion of an intended queued follow-up into a fresh turn with no clear user feedback.
