# Investigate intermittent /queue re-parenting regression for in-flight turns

## Summary

A fresh user report says that when queueing an item, some in-flight long-running
requests are still being visually parented to the queued turn instead of the
original triggering turn.

This appears to be either:
- a regression against the previously closed `/queue` threading fix, or
- an intermittent remaining edge case that the earlier fix did not fully cover.

## Current Behavior

- During a long-running in-flight request, invoking `/queue` can still sometimes
  cause subsequent streamed updates to appear under the queued turn.
- The bug is reported as intermittent rather than deterministic.
- The visible symptom is incorrect thread parenting in the timeline.

## Desired Behavior

- In-flight streamed updates must remain visually parented to the original turn
  for the full duration of that turn.
- Queued items must always remain isolated as separate future turns.
- Any previously fixed cases should remain covered while this intermittent case
  is investigated.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Reproduce the intermittent regression or identify the missing edge case relative to the earlier `/queue` fix.
- [ ] Determine whether the issue is persistence/thread metadata, streaming UI state, or a remaining mutable turn-context bug.
- [ ] Fix the regression without reintroducing the originally closed `/queue` bug.
- [ ] Add or extend regression coverage for the intermittent/long-running case.
- [ ] Document how this differs from the previously completed ticket.

## Notes

- This should be treated as a follow-up/regression ticket to:
  - `/workspace/kanban/50-done/queue-reparents-inflight-turns.md`
- Important distinction in the new report: this is about *sometimes* and *long requests*, which may indicate a different timing window than the original deterministic case.

## Updates

### 2026-03-14 (resolved)
- **Root cause confirmed** — same underlying bug as `fix-stale-thread-root-on-queued-web-chat-retry`:
  `processChat(threadRootId)` receives the thread root from whichever
  `handleAgentMessage` enqueued the queue task, but cursor-ordered message
  selection (`getMessagesSince`) may pick a *different* pending message
  (the earlier one). The response to message A is then cross-parented
  under message B's thread.
- **Fixed** in commit `a27a860`: `processChat` now reads `thread_id` from the
  actual `currentMessage` (via updated `getMessagesSince` SQL that includes
  `thread_id` in its SELECT) and derives `effectiveThreadRootId =
  messageThreadId ?? threadRootId`. The explicit parameter is only a fallback.
- The intermittent nature is explained by the timing: it only happens when two
  messages are pending simultaneously with different thread roots, which
  requires the second message to be submitted before the first is processed.
- All 792 tests pass. All acceptance criteria are met by the same fix that
  resolved the sibling ticket.

### 2026-03-13
- Added from new user report that long-running in-flight requests can still sometimes be visually parented to the queued turn rather than the original turn.
