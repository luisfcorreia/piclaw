# Close exported JSDoc gaps in web VNC session service

## Summary

Follow-up from `kanban/50-done/audit-exported-jsdoc-coverage-and-comment-quality.md`.
The merged active-seam JSDoc pass covered web HTTP, handlers, and WebAuthn challenge helpers, but
`runtime/src/channels/web/vnc/vnc-session-service.ts` still exposes multiple exported interfaces,
functions, and a class with minimal or missing review-gate documentation.

## Scope

Primary follow-up scope:
- `runtime/src/channels/web/vnc/vnc-session-service.ts`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Exported interfaces/types in scope have type-level and property-level JSDoc.
- [x] Exported functions in scope have purpose + `@param` / `@returns` docs where applicable.
- [x] Exported classes in scope have class-level docs and public method docs.
- [x] Runtime behavior remains unchanged (documentation-only unless typing cleanup is required).
- [x] Validation evidence (`eslint` targeted + lint + typecheck) is recorded in ticket updates.

## Updates

### 2026-03-27
- Lane change: `10-next` → `50-done` after closing the remaining exported-doc gap cluster in `runtime/src/channels/web/vnc/vnc-session-service.ts`.
- Added review-gate JSDoc coverage for:
  - exported interfaces/types and their properties
  - exported parsing helpers with explicit `@param` / `@returns`
  - `VncSessionService` constructor and public methods
- Runtime behavior remained unchanged; this was a docs-only pass.
- Validation:
  - `bun test --max-concurrency=1 runtime/test/channels/web/vnc-session-service.test.ts` (6 pass / 0 fail)
  - `bun run lint` (pass)
  - `bun run typecheck` (pass)
- Quality: ★★★★★ 9/10 (problem: 2, scope: 2, test: 2, deps: 1, risk: 2)

### 2026-03-27
- Created after reviewing the merged autoresearch JSDoc branch and confirming that remaining adjacent exported-doc gaps now cluster in `runtime/src/channels/web/vnc/vnc-session-service.ts`.
- Evidence source:
  - export inventory commands over the active web seams
  - autoresearch branch retarget note for the VNC session service seam
