# Consolidate duplicated WebChannel test bootstrap fixtures

## Summary

Multiple WebChannel-focused suites repeat nearly identical setup glue for:
- temp workspace + env wiring,
- DB init/reset and default chat seeding,
- minimal `WebChannel` constructor fixture scaffolding.

This ticket tracks extracting shared test fixtures/helpers for those suites without changing runtime behavior.

## Why

The duplication is substantial and high-churn, but touching it in the small Path A cleanup would have widened blast radius too far for a low-risk pass.

## Scope

- Extract shared helper(s) for repeated WebChannel test setup only.
- Migrate a narrow, representative subset first.
- Keep test readability and failure diagnosability.

## Non-goals

- No production architecture rewrite.
- No behavior change to WebChannel request/response logic.
- No test deletion unless equivalent/stronger behavioral coverage remains.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Shared setup helper(s) replace duplicated setup blocks in at least 2 WebChannel test files.
- [x] Affected tests remain green.
- [x] Lint and typecheck remain green.
- [x] Any pruned tests include explicit equivalent coverage notes. *(N/A: no tests were pruned in this pass.)*

## Updates

### 2026-03-27
- Split out from `reduce-code-duplication-and-prune-redundant-tests` Path A pass after identifying broader WebChannel test fixture duplication as a larger/riskier candidate.
- Completed an initial narrow fixture extraction with a new helper: `runtime/test/channels/web/helpers/web-channel-fixture.ts`.
- Migrated two representative suites to the shared helper:
  - `runtime/test/channels/web/web-agent-streaming.test.ts`
  - `runtime/test/channels/web/chat-isolation.test.ts`
- The helper now centralizes:
  - workspace/env wiring
  - DB initialization
  - optional reset/seed hooks
  - minimal `WebChannel` construction
  - captured broadcast-event collection for assertions
- Validation:
  - `bun test --max-concurrency=1 runtime/test/channels/web/web-agent-streaming.test.ts runtime/test/channels/web/chat-isolation.test.ts`
  - `bun run lint`
  - `bun run typecheck`
- This keeps the pass intentionally narrow and leaves larger WebChannel suite migrations for follow-up work if still worthwhile.
