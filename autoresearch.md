# Autoresearch: audit silent catch blocks

## Objective
Clean up the remaining stale documentation language now that the silent-catch audit is complete. The implementation, tests, quality hooks, CI guard, governing ticket, and master tracker are all aligned; this pass is about historical clarity.

Success means historical docs/tickets no longer read as if the audit is still pending in the present tense, while still preserving the original assessment snapshot.

We are optimizing for durable closure while keeping the repo state coherent.

## Metrics
- **Primary**: `stale_audit_reference_gaps` (count, lower is better) — outdated docs/ticket references that still describe the silent-catch problem as currently unresolved without noting completion
- **Secondary**:
  - `repo_silent_catch_blocks` — repo-wide empty `catch {}` count (should stay 0)
  - `repo_silent_promise_catches` — repo-wide empty `.catch(() => {})` count (should stay 0)
  - `guard_check_present` — 1 when package/quality guard wiring still exists, else 0

## How to Run
`./autoresearch.sh` — emits structured `METRIC name=value` lines.

## Files in Scope
- `docs/quality-assessment-2026-03-23.md` — historical assessment that should note the audit is now complete
- `kanban/40-review/audit-silent-catch-blocks.md` — governing ticket whose summary wording should be historically accurate
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `runtime/scripts/silent-swallow-metrics.ts`, `runtime/test/scripts/silent-swallow-metrics.test.ts`, `autoresearch.checks.sh`, `package.json` — guard infrastructure that must remain intact
- `runtime/src/**`, `runtime/web/src/**`, `runtime/scripts/**`, `runtime/extensions/**`, `runtime/test/**`, `skel/scripts/**` — monitored repo code that must remain at zero silent swallows

## Off Limits
- `runtime/web/static/**`
- vendored/minified files
- generated artifacts unless required by the normal build
- unrelated refactors outside silent-catch auditing

## Constraints
- Keep behavior stable
- No new dependencies
- TypeScript must typecheck
- Relevant tests must pass after kept changes
- Prefer comments for expected/racy cleanup paths; prefer warnings for unexpected failures in backend/critical paths

## What's Been Tried
- Baseline established at `silent_catch_blocks=97`, `critical_silent_catches=33`, `silent_promise_catches=17`.
- Audited all empty `catch {}` blocks in `runtime/src` + `runtime/web/src` and removed the bare-empty form entirely.
- Backend/critical-path changes now log when hidden failures would matter: agent-pool branch/session sync, web theme init fallback, oversized upload cleanup, workspace menu actions, tab listener failures, and WhatsApp availability publishing.
- Intentional/racy cleanup paths now carry explicit `/* expected: ... */` justification comments instead of silent empties: PTY/procfs scans, websocket teardown, iframe/widget messaging, localStorage writes, pointer capture, resize observers, Ghostty/terminal teardown, and browser popup/mobile viewport quirks.
- Follow-up sweep also removed promise-style silent swallows such as `.catch(() => {})`, again preferring explicit justification comments for expected best-effort UI/background work.
- Core runtime/web scope is now at zero silent catches and zero silent promise swallows.
- Resume target: remaining repo-wide code outside the core runtime/web path still has a small tail of empty cleanup catches in scripts/extensions/tests/skel; finish that tail without regressing the cleaned core scope.
- Benchmark instrumentation was tightened to ignore comment-only false positives while still counting real empty catch blocks in code.
- Repo-wide code is now at zero silent catches and zero silent promise swallows.
- New target: convert the scanner into a durable regression guard by wiring it into package scripts, `quality`, and autoresearch checks.
- Added `runtime/scripts/silent-swallow-metrics.ts --check`, a `check:silent-swallows` package script, `quality` integration, and an autoresearch backpressure check so regressions now fail fast.
- New target: add focused tests for the scanner itself so comment handling and `--check` semantics stay reliable.
- Focused tests exposed and then fixed an underlying bug in the scanner: it originally ignored comments but still counted `catch {}` patterns inside strings/template text. The scanner now masks all non-code spans and the dedicated script test covers comment-only false positives, real detections, and `--check` failure behavior.
- New target: wire `check:silent-swallows` into CI so the audit guard is enforced outside local/autoresearch workflows too.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now runs `bun run check:silent-swallows` before the web build, closing the last obvious enforcement gap.
- New target: update the governing kanban ticket so its lane/status/acceptance criteria reflect the completed audit and new regression guards.
- The governing ticket has been moved to `kanban/40-review/`, its status/frontmatter were updated, acceptance criteria were checked off, and evidence notes now mention the quality/autoresearch/CI guard layers.
- New target: sync the master `codebase-quality-cleanup-2026` tracker so it no longer reports the silent-catch audit as `next`.
- The master tracker row for `audit-silent-catch-blocks` now matches reality (`review`), so the portfolio view is no longer stale.
- New target: add completion notes / past-tense wording where historical docs still read like the silent-catch audit is currently unresolved.
- Historical docs are now explicit: the 2026-03-23 quality assessment carries a dated completion note, and the governing ticket summary now describes the 188-catch finding in past tense.
