# Send a Message

Write a JSON file to the piclaw IPC directory to send a message right away.

## Usage

```bash
cat > "$PICLAW_DATA/ipc/messages/msg_$(date +%s).json" <<EOF
{
  "type": "message",
  "chatJid": "$PICLAW_CHAT_JID",
  "text": "Your message here"
}
EOF
```

## When to Use

- Acknowledge a request before starting longer work: "On it, this might take a minute..."
- Send progress updates during a multi-step task
- Deliver partial results while continuing to work

## Notes

- Messages are picked up by piclaw within ~1 second
- The IPC file is deleted after the message is sent
- Use WhatsApp-compatible formatting: *bold*, _italic_, • bullets, ```code```
- Do NOT use this for your final response — just return that normally

## Environment

- `PICLAW_DATA` — piclaw data directory (contains `ipc/messages/`)
- `PICLAW_CHAT_JID` — JID of the chat that triggered this invocation
