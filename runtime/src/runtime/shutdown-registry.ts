/**
 * runtime/shutdown-registry.ts – Global shutdown handle for agent-initiated exits.
 *
 * bootstrapRuntime() registers the graceful shutdown handler here after
 * startup. The exit_process tool and /exit slash command call
 * requestGracefulShutdown() to trigger the same orderly teardown
 * (queue drain → session dispose → web stop → process.exit) that SIGINT uses.
 *
 * For agent-initiated exits (exit_process tool), the actual shutdown is
 * **deferred** until the current turn completes and is persisted to the DB.
 * Call markPendingShutdown() during a tool call, then checkPendingShutdown()
 * from finalizeSuccessfulRun() after the response is committed.
 *
 * isPendingShutdown() returns true while the flag is set, so the run-agent
 * orchestrator can abort the session immediately after the exit_process tool
 * executes — preventing further tool calls in the same turn.
